# CLS

My implementation of `ls`, done as an exercise for the prep part of [Computer Science Intensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDVC3wKjS64) course at Bradfield.

## Usage

To compile, simply run

```sh
make
```

That will produce a executable binary, called `ls` that lists files. It can
accept a directory as the first argument or not, and optional flags.

Available flags are `r` for reverse ordering, and `a` for showing hidden files.
