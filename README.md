# CLS

My implementation of `ls`, done as an exercise for the prep part of [Computer Science Intensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDVC3wKjS64) course at Bradfield.

## Usage

To compile, simply run

```sh
make
```

That will produce a executable binary, called `ls`

## TODO, also known as "Features List"

- [ ] show sizes of the files
- [ ] enable reverse listing
